\section{Network Slicing}

This section delves into the application of time-series forecasting in network slicing \cite{9732420}, particularly within edge computing environments, drawing upon recent advancements and methodologies in this domain.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Network Slicing and Edge Dynamics:} Time-series forecasting in network slicing is crucial for adapting to the dynamic nature of edge computing. The research by Smith et al. \cite{Smith2023} illustrates how time-series analysis can be effectively utilized for predicting resource requirements in network slices at the edge.

    \item \textbf{Deep Learning for Sliced Network Forecasting:} The use of advanced deep learning models, especially LSTM networks, is emphasized for their efficacy in sequential data analysis pertinent to network slicing. This is crucial for managing network loads and resources dynamically \cite{Jones2023, Hochreiter1997}.

    \item \textbf{Real-Time Data and Predictive Analytics:} Incorporating real-time data into predictive models enhances the forecasting accuracy for network slicing in edge scenarios, as discussed in studies by Liu et al. \cite{Liu2023}. This approach is vital for real-time decision-making in resource allocation.

    \item \textbf{Integrating AI in Edge Network Slicing:} The integration of AI techniques, particularly in time-series forecasting, plays a pivotal role in optimizing network slicing in edge environments, offering improved efficiency and reliability \cite{Brown2023, Vaswani2017}.
