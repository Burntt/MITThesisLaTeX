\section{VNF Demand Forecasting}

This section is based on the framework and methodologies presented by Kim et al. \cite{Kim2023}.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Time-Series Analysis in VNFs:} The study emphasizes the importance of time-series analysis for predicting VNF demands, particularly in dynamic network environments. By analyzing historical data and patterns within VNF interactions, these models can forecast future resource requirements effectively \cite{Kim2023, Hochreiter1997}.

    \item \textbf{Integration of SFC Data for Accurate Predictions:} The research underscores the use of Service Function Chaining (SFC) data, combined with time-series analysis, to enhance the accuracy of VNF demand predictions. This approach is vital for managing resources efficiently in NFV scenarios \cite{Mijumbi2016, Graves2005}.

    \item \textbf{Deep Learning Models for Time-Series Forecasting:} The application of LSTM and bidirectional LSTM models is particularly noted for their effectiveness in handling sequential data and predicting future VNF resource usage \cite{Tang2015, Graves2005}.

    \item \textbf{Attention Mechanisms in Time-Series Models:} Incorporating attention-based mechanisms, as suggested by Vaswani et al. \cite{Vaswani2017}, has shown to significantly improve the focus and accuracy of time-series forecasting models in predicting VNF demands.
