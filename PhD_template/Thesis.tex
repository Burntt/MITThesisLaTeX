\documentclass[twoside]{mitthesis} %,fontset=libertine ,fontset=newtx-sans-text, fontset=heros-stix2, fontset=stix2
%
% option [twoside]		gives facing-page behavior for printing; omitting it will eliminate even-numbered blank pages.
% option [lineno]	 	provides line numbers, as for editing
% option [mydesign] 	loads packages for color, title and list formats, margins, or captions: edit mydesign.tex to change defaults.
% option [fontset] is a keyvalue which can be:
%					 	pdftex or unicode engines:  defaultfonts, libertine, lucida
%					 	pdftex only: 				fira-newtxsf, newtx, newtx-sans-text
%						unicode engines (luatex):	heros-stix2, stix2, termes, termes-stix2
%					 	if no key value is given, fonts default to CMR (pdftex) or LMR (unicode), i.e., "the latex font".
%					 	You can edit the fontset files or you can write your own, myfonts.tex, and do [fontset=myfonts].
%						If you are using multiple languages, load the babel package in your fontset file, before the fonts.

%%%%%%%%% Packages used in sample chapters (not otherwise required) %%%%%%%

%% Package for code listing in Appendix A.
\usepackage{listings}

%% Set chemical formulas nicely
\usepackage[version=4]{mhchem}

%% Latin filler used in Chapter 1, with a test for package version date
\usepackage{lipsum}
\IfPackageAtLeastTF{lipsum}{2021/09/20}{\setlipsum{auto-lang=false}}{}


%%%%%%%%%  Graphics path (to figure files)  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% Can set graphicspath to point to specific directories containing figures (the current directory is searched automatically)
%% For instance, to search a subdirectory of the current directory called "figures" and a parallel directory called "art", set:

% \graphicspath{ {figures/} {../art/} }% For details see: https://latexref.xyz/dev/latex2e.html#g_t_005cgraphicspath


%%%%%%%%%  Representative set-up for biblatex  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\usepackage[style=ieee,maxbibnames=10,sorting=none]{biblatex}% style=ext-numeric-comp,articlein=false,giveninits=true

\addbibresource{references.bib}%% <    %% <== change to YOUR bib file <=================

%% These two commands enable line breaks in long URLs in the bibliography (delete if you don't want that)
\setcounter{biburllcpenalty}{7000}
\setcounter{biburlucpenalty}{8000}

% biblatex is very powerful, and you can customize most aspects the reference list and citations.


%%%%%%%%%%  Option to use natbib   %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%\RequirePackage[numbers,sort&compress]{natbib}
 
%%% add bibliography to table of contents
%\apptocmd{\bibliography}{\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{\protect\textbf{\bibname}}}{}{}

%%% You can use this to rename the bibliography section
%\renewcommand{\bibname}{References}

%%% Can adjust space between bibliography items (change 4pt to something else; don't drop last two lengths, they are stretchable "glue")
%\setlength\bibsep{4pt plus 1pt minus 1pt}


%%%%%%%%%%  Table related packages  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\usepackage{booktabs}% better quality tables
\usepackage{array}% additional options for table columns

%\usepackage{tabularx}

%\usepackage{dcolumn} % alignment on decimal places
%\newcolumntype{d}[1]{D{.}{.}{#1}}


%%%%%%%%%%  Option for "double spacing" %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% Back in the typewriter era, double spaced lines were convenient for editing with a pencil. 
%% In typography, the separation between lines is called "leading", and it is usually set in 
%% proportion to the font size (i.e., when the font is loaded).  If you really feel the need 
%% to change the line separation, the most attractive results will be obtained by changing the
%% leading in proportion to the the current font size, rather than just doubling the space.

%% The setspace package provides a tool for changing line separation (use these here)
%
%\usepackage{setspace}
%\setstretch{1.1}% you can choose some other value for the stretch of space between lines
%
%% Use the these commands AFTER the frontmatter
%
%\onehalfspacing
%\doublespacing
%\singlespacing  % will turn these effects off (you can use these anywhere in the document)

%% The best result may be to stay with leading selected by the typographer who set up the font.
